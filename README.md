## Passenger: Sinatra example app

This is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) hello world example app for 
[the Passenger application server](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/).

The `main` branch contains the code without Passenger installed.

The `end_result` branch contains the code with Passenger installed.

Run `git diff origin/master..origin/end_result` to see what's different.

### Running the App

Install dependencies locally:

```bash
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle install
```
Run the application:
```bash
bundle exec passenger start
```

You can then view the application by pointing your browser to localhost:port
where port is the number given when starting the application.
